# PyGraphistry Code of Conduct

PyGraphistry is an open-source project built on collaboration and respect. This Code of Conduct lays out how we expect everyone to interact so we can maintain a positive and productive environment.

## How We Work Together

- Treat others decently—listen, respond constructively, and keep it professional.
- Stay focused on ideas and solutions, not personal disagreements.
- Be helpful, especially to newcomers or those asking for clarification.

## What’s Not Okay

Harassment, personal attacks, or sharing private information without permission are not okay. Be respectful and avoid language or behavior that alienates or disrupts others.

## Where This Applies

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to the PyGraphistry project, like GitHub repositories, pull request discussions, and private communications. If you’re representing PyGraphistry in public (e.g., social media or events), we expect the same standards of behavior.

## If There’s a Problem

If you see or experience behavior that doesn’t align with this Code of Conduct, let us know at **[oss@graphistry.com](mailto:oss@graphistry.com)**. We’ll handle it privately and work together to figure out the next steps.

## What Happens Next

Breaking the rules? We’ll handle it case by case. You might get a warning, a temporary ban, or permanent removal from the project.
