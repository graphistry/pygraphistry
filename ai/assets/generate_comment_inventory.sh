# Generate Comment Inventory for DECOMMENT Protocol
#
# Usage: ./ai/assets/generate_comment_inventory.sh [base_branch] [output_file]
#
# This script automates Phase 1 of the DECOMMENT protocol by extracting all
# comments added in a PR and formatting them with context for categorization.
#
# Example:
#   ./ai/assets/generate_comment_inventory.sh master plans/my-feature/comment_inventory.md

set -euo pipefail

# Parse arguments
BASE_BRANCH=${1:-master}
OUTPUT_FILE=${2:-}

# Detect current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Try to get PR number if available
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A")

# Count comments added in this PR
COMMENT_COUNT=$(git diff "$BASE_BRANCH...HEAD" | grep -c "^+.*#" || echo "0")

# Generate output
{
cat <<EOF
# Comment Inventory - PR #${PR_NUMBER}

Generated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
Base branch: $BASE_BRANCH
PR branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH
Total comments found: $COMMENT_COUNT

**Instructions**:
1. Review each comment below
2. Mark category as KEEP or REMOVE
3. Document reasoning for each decision
4. Update Summary Statistics at bottom
5. Proceed to Phase 3 (removal) for all REMOVE comments
