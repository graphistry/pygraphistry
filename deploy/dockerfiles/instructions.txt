# WHAT IS THIS?

These are instructions to get a single-node setup of Graphistry up and running, on an Ubuntu box that you have provisioned. You should have received this inside a package of:

  * instructions.txt (these instructions)
  * certs.txt (how to generate certs)
  * containers.lxc.gz (the Docker containers with the relevant code)
  * load.sh (loads containers for use)
  * launch.sh (run the server)

# WHAT WILL WE BE DOING?

First, we will be preparing a machine to run Docker containers that can take advantage of the machine's GPU. This is a one-time task.
Second, we will be loading a few containers onto that machine that, in the ensemble, run Graphistry.

# HOW LONG SHOULD THIS TAKE?

Preparing a machine to run Docker containers should take around an hour (provisioning, finding a new version of Ubuntu, running the scripts).
Loading new versions of the containers onto the machine should take under a minute.

# WHAT DO I NEED?

You will need a box running the Docker engine, with the nvidia-docker standalone installation, with a GPU that can run Cuda 7.5, connected to the Internet and connected to a box running an Ansible playbook, also connected to the Internet.

Currently, the only supported and tested configuration is
  * Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty LTS
  * NVIDIA Grid K2 (g2.2xlarge on AWS EC2) or NVIDIA Tesla K40/K80.

# PREPARE THE MACHINE.

## SET UP NVIDIA-DOCKER.

### SET UP NVIDIA-DOCKER WITH OUR PROCESS.

1. Checkout the infrastructure repository at https://github.com/graphistry/infrastructure/ .
2. Run through the setup at https://github.com/graphistry/infrastructure/tree/master/nvidia-docker-host . If the script runs through, your machine will have passed a test of using Docker to run GPU computation (matrix multiplication in this case).

### OR SET UP NVIDIA-DOCKER WITH YOUR PROCESS.

1. Test that a machine that is set up with nvidia-docker (via https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Deploy-on-Amazon-EC2 ) can run the cljs convolution demo.
2. Run
    nvidia-docker run -P 3001 graphistry/cljs:1.0
on your machine. You should be able to go to <machine>:3001/?mode=opencl and see the bear outline rendered in a few milliseconds.

## SET UP GRAPHISTRY.

1. Unpack the package of files into a directory, and run `load.sh` . This should load the airgapped Graphistry deploy into your local Docker engine. 
2. Graphistry can terminate SSL, but by default will not. Follow the instructions in certs.txt for making certs, and for subsequent runtime parameters during launch, if you intend for Graphistry itself to terminate SSL.

# RUN THE APP.

`./launch.sh` .

# STOP THE APP. (RARE.)

Run `docker stop graphistry_mongo graphistry_nginx graphistry_httpd`.

# VIEWING LOGS.

Logs are mounted in the working directory of where you run launch.sh.

There are client logs, in clients/, server logs, in graphistry-json/, other assorted logs in central-app/ and worker/.

If you want debug logs, launch with the environment variable of GRAPHISTRY_LOG_LEVEL set to DEBUG; i.e. `GRAPHISTRY_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ./launch.sh` .

# VERIFYING THAT THE APP IS RUNNING

When you have launched the app, you should be able to point your browser to that machine via HTTP and receive a page with four links on it, each of which take you to a visualization of a different data set.

# USE A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK WITH PYGRAPHISTRY INSTALLED.

These are public images, available on DockerHub, built on the Jupyter notebooks with pygraphistry installed, with several demo notebooks.

Run `docker run -p 8888:8888  --restart=unless-stopped --name graphistry_notebook -d graphistry/jupyter-notebook:1.1`.
