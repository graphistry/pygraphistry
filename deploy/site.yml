# TODO: Ensure that the process that the nodejs apps (central, workers) run under (currently 'www')
# has limited access. No home folder, only has read-only access to npm modules used, no access to
# .git directories, ideally no access to any SSH keys, can only write to /var/log/clients.log.

# TODO: Automatically clear the MongoDB when deploying

# TODO: Secure sensitive data:
# * Username/password variable files should be encrypted and/or distributed out-of-band.
# * No SSH deploy key in repo (refactor GitHub tasks to use SSH agent forwarding).
# * No Ansible SSH private key in repo (users use their own SSH keys to log in either as `ubuntu`,
#   like present, or even as their own user account.)
# * Review account creation and permissions on 'production' machines.
# * Consider requiring passwords for `sudo` (refactor Ansible to prompt users for sudo password.)

# TODO: write out lock/status file at beginning of deploys, with the user who ran ansible, time and
# inventory filename. At the end of deploys, delete this file and add a similar file reporting
# success (this file should be deleted at the beginning of deploys.) We can further add a check at
# the beginning of deploys for this lock file (or maybe just lock files from other users?) and not
# continue if one is found.

# TODO: Turn on gather_facts by default in ansible.cfg, but create a new play for all hosts but
# localhost to run the common role, where we turn it off. There are too many edge cases where we use
# ansible facts, but we haven't run the setup module manually for one reason or another.
