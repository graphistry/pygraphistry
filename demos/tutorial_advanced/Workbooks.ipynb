    "- Workbooks are **not** bound to any particular dataset, meaning that the same workbook can be used across many different dataset.\n",
    "    - This design allows workbooks to be shared amongst analysts, even if they have different access permissions to the data. \n",
    "    - Additionally, for on-premise costumers who require a 'read-process-discard' security model, workbooks allow you to resume an investigation even if the last dataset was discarded. \n",
    "    - This design is also valuable to analyze time-dependent datasets. For example, a user can reuse the same workbook to analyze a graph of the day's highest priority security events. \n",
    "    - Or alternatively, different datasets that represent similar entities and connections (In this tutorial, we use one workbook to examine two different social networks graphs)"
