PyGraphistry's documentation (|version|)
========================================

.. Quickstart:
.. `Read our tutorial <https://github.com/graphistry/pygraphistry/blob/master/README.md>`_

PyGraphistry is a Python visual graph AI library to extract, transform, analyze, model, and visualize big graphs, and especially alongside Graphistry end-to-end GPU server sessions. Installing optional graphistry[ai] dependencies adds graph autoML, including automatic feature engineering, UMAP, and graph neural net support. Combined, PyGraphistry reduces your time to graph for going from raw data to visualizations and AI models down to three lines of code.
Here in our docstrings you can find useful packages, modules, commands to maximize your graph AI experience with PyGraphistry. For a full tutorial, refer to our `PyGraphistry <https://github.com/graphistry/pygraphistry/>`_ repo.
