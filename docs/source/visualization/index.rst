Visualize
=============

We recommend getting started with :ref:`10 Minutes to PyGraphistry <10min>`, :ref:`10 Minutes to Graphistry Visualization<10min-viz>`, and the :ref:`layout guide <layout-guide>`.
For advanced, subset-based coloring, see :ref:`Layout settings <layout-settings>` and the
`Collections tutorial notebook <https://github.com/graphistry/pygraphistry/blob/master/demos/more_examples/graphistry_features/collections.ipynb>`_.

For static image export (documentation, reports), see the `static rendering tutorial <../demos/demos_databases_apis/graphviz/static_rendering.ipynb>`_.
