---------------------

PyGraphistry supports GPU-accelerated layouts, including ForceAtlas2, modularity-weighted algorithms, and hierarchical ring layouts for large-scale and specialized structures. (:ref:`API reference on Graphistry layouts <pyg-layout-api>`)

**Supported Layouts**:

- **ForceAtlas2** — Optimized for large, dense graphs. Provides smooth clustering and cluster separation using GPU acceleration. PyGraphistry version gives visual and performance improvements upon other systems, and Graphistry server load-time version provides a different set of features focused on interactivity and additional options. :ref:`API info on FA2 layouts <fa2-api>`

.. _graphviz-plugin:

Graphviz Plugin
----------------

Graphviz specializes in directed and hierarchical layouts, useful for flowcharts, dependency trees, and acyclic graphs (DAGs). (:ref:`API reference on graphviz layouts <graphviz>`)

**Supported Layouts**:

- **acyclic** — Removes cycles from directed graphs by reversing edges to make the graph acyclic, useful for processing DAGs.
- **ccomps** — Extracts the connected components from a graph and outputs them as subgraphs.
- **circo** — Circular layout, arranging nodes in a radial fashion, ideal for cycle graphs.
- **dot** — Best for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) like flowcharts, laying out hierarchies in a top-down manner.
- **fdp** — General force-directed layout, good for smaller undirected graphs.
- **gc** — Used for graph coloring, assigning colors to nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
- **gvcolor** — Colorizes graphs based on specific attributes, often used for improving visual distinctions between nodes.
- **gvpr** — Graph pattern scanning and rewriting tool used for scripting changes in a graph, allowing custom manipulation of graph structures.
- **neato** — Force-directed layout for undirected graphs, suitable for smaller networks.
- **nop** — A no-op layout that performs no layout calculations, often used as a placeholder or for manual layout adjustments.
- **osage** — Useful for directed layered graphs with hierarchical structures.
- **patchwork** — Visualizes hierarchical clusters as a nested set of rectangles, similar to a treemap visualization.
- **sccmap** — Finds the strongly connected components in a graph and generates a reduced graph of those components.
- **sfdp** — Force-directed layout optimized for large graphs, providing fast and scalable rendering.
- **tred** — Transitive reduction algorithm that minimizes the number of edges while maintaining reachability between nodes in a directed graph.
- **twopi** — Radial layout that positions nodes in concentric circles, useful for radial hierarchies.
- **unflatten** — Improves readability by adjusting node levels to reduce overlap in hierarchical graphs.

**Example**:

.. _custom-layouts:

Custom Layouts
---------------

Users can manually compute layouts from external sources or post-process the results. This allows flexibility in integrating custom embedding algorithms or other specialized layouts into PyGraphistry. (`API reference <pyg-layout-api>`_)

**Example**:

Manually apply a layout and visualize by `custom layouts (notebook) <../../demos/more_examples/graphistry_features/external_layout/simple_manual_layout.ipynb>`_ .

.. code-block:: python

    # Input: Precompute some x and y positions
    nodes_df : pd.DataFrame = ...
    assert 'x' in df.columns and 'y' in df.columns

    g2 = (g1
        .nodes(nodes_df)
        .bind(point_x='x', point_y='y')
        .settings(url_params={'play': 0})  # Prevent loadtime layout from running
    )
