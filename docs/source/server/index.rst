PyGraphistry streamlines working with optional Graphistry server capabilities such as GPU-accelerated visual analytics, sharing visualizations, simplifying graph pipelines, GFQL compute endpoints, and sharing GPU resources.

Server interactions are typically by first logging in (`graphistry.register()`) and then sending data, such as via `g.plot()`. You can set access control policies on all of your uploaded data via `graphistry.privacy()`. Read on for more on both.
