856368,Mother has short term memory issues at her early 40’s,"She tells me a joke or news about work and she’ll tell me again 10h later and then the next day. She has to tell me something 3 times under 2 days and then she remembers she told me it. It isn’t for huge things like my name or where we live. But she can’t recall minor things like that she told me to call my sister a few hours back. This has been happening for like 1 year. I told her about her memory today. She started to cry when I pointed out things she already told me yesterday. So I stopped pointing it out. Is this just part of aging and being in your 40’s or something else? She never had any mental health issues, she had a rough life in africa til she was 18. But overall a happy person with good emotional stability If it helps my little brother and older sister have bad memory too. They forget some events that happened at family vacations when we were 5-12 y She’s had more responsibility at work and paying off some stuff. So maybe she’s juggling too much at once and that’s causing forgetfulness?",None,subs,neuro
929759,Could I buy a company with stocks?,"I'm an amateur investor. Meaning I know nothing about stocks or how they work. I'm looking to get a crash course in some angles. So let's say I have a company that I really like, but I really want to buy their stocks and essentially `own` the company. Is that possible? Some questions that come up when I think about this:  Let's say I own 1% of the company in question, do I get the power to vote on changes in their company? Let's say an investor company has 51% of the stocks in a company, does that mean my votes are insignificant while they hold majority? Could I as an investor make changes to the company based on my stock holdings? For example, let's say I tell the company to use the older materials because it is safer although it is more expensive.  I'm not really concerned about capital, I'm just a layman, but I just want to understand what I could do as a shareholder. A crash course in stocks revolving around how it impacts the company I hold.",None,subs,investing
1163407,on He Listed a T. Rex Fossil on eBay for $2.95 Million. Scientists Weren’t Thrilled.,"Sure, we should pay in proportion to the amount of the genetic code of the T. Rex invented by the fossil hunter. Everyone should be compensated for the things that they create. What's that, all he did was find it? Well then he should be compensated in proportion to that. I don't have an exact answer. But it's not very different in my mind from a society having the right to charge mineral taxes, because otherwise resources built over millions of years can be drained in a generation. We recognize there is a distinction between the person who extracts something and the thing itself. And really, if politicians were less corrupt, that distinction would be drawn far more firmly, and extraction of dwindling resources would be far more costly than it is today. That any individual should have legal ownership not only of a plot of land but of a slice penetrating all the way down to the earth's core and everything that happens to be inside of that slice is a useful legal fiction. Among other justifications, it's a fiction that contributes to the economically productive use of the land. But it doesn't really make sense for any individual to have absolute right to do whatever they want with rare, million+ year-old remnants of bygone worlds, or the right to claim all resultant profits. Sure, give them some compensation for finding something old and important. But don't pretend it makes sense for them to have absolute ownership of it. And definitely don't pretend that the price a billionaire happens to be willing to pay for a baby T. rex fossil actually represents its inherent value in any meaningful way.",None,comments,biology
2032529,"on Stripper in Oregon, not sure how to estimate annual income for quarterly payments, ALSO do I have to pay a state and federal SE tax??","It's going to depend on what your overall income is for the year, from all sources of income. Your dancing income is self-employment income, and on a Schedule C (or C-EZ) you will list your income and business expenses if any, to determine your profit. It's the SE profit that has the SE tax applied to it. See Schedule SE. First you compute 92.35% of your profit, and then you apply the 15.3% to that. So it turns out to be about 14.1% of your profit. One of the schedules you attach to your Form 1040 will have a line where you enter the SE tax amount. Your SE profit also gets put onto your Form 1040 as business profit, so it gets added to any other income you have for the year. Then there's a line where you get to remove 1 of the SE taxes amount as a deduction. Then as usual you get to use a standard deduction amount (or itemized deduction amount). There's also a new QBI (qualified business income) deduction that you compute after you figure out your AGI minus your standard deduction. If 20% of that amount is smaller than 20% of your business income, that's your QBI deduction. (See details in the Form 1040 instructions -- this is a new boon to self-employed people.) It's only after that that you finally know your `taxable income` figure that you look up in the tax table, to figure out your income tax. Your total tax due will be the combination of the income tax and the SE taxes. Next April, you can think about 2020 taxes. Since you'll be having some amount of tax in 2019, you will have some amount of `estimated tax` to pay during 2020, but you can wait until April to figure that out.

6372226,So my boyfriend has gained weight and now he won't touch me.,"So my boyfriend has gained weight over the course of our relationship. I found him beautiful and sexy at the start and believe me when I say I still do now. The problem is that as he's gained weight he's become much more self-conscious and much less often in the mood. He's currently working on becoming a weight that he feels more comfortable with and I've been supporting him in every way I can. I know that it takes time and patience and I'll always be here for him but I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how I can make him feel better about his appearance and feel better about intimacy. I tell him in many ways that he's attractive every day (both inside and out), I just want to know if there's more I can do.",/u/holms090,summary,askgaybros
8500226,I wish I was a banana,"Just think about it. There in the corner of your room, there it is, blissfully existing, being in this grand scheme of things, and as small as it is - it still is, it's as real as you or me, yet it doesn't have to worry about this and that, It doesn't have capabilities to do that. `Obviously dude, that's a banana.` - angrily you said. But does that make banana superior? The ability to simply be, without being bothered, to simply `live` life the way it was intended for her, without any blockages or worries. Now we may think that we're superior to that banana, and that's completely true in many aspects, but matter of the fact is that a banana is never gonna worry, cry, mourn, or have to care about anything. Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. I wish I was a god damn banana.",/u/luketheduke31,summary,depression

It also provides the functionality of an ISR monitor, DPC monitor and a hard pagefault monitor. Requires Windows Vista or later. Appreciation to aberugg who tells us, `LatencyMon will check all sorts of info down to what driver might be the culprit. It will help you narrow it down even more. This tool helped me realize that Windows 10's kernel is terrible in terms of device latency when compared to previous versions.` GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs—like a single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input—in parallel on one or more computers. Typical input is a list of files, hosts, users, URLs or tables. A job can also be a command that reads from a pipe, which can then be split and piped into commands in parallel. Velenux finds it `handy to split jobs when you have many cores to use.` Kanboard is open-source project management software that features a simple, intuitive user interface, a clear overview of your tasks—with search and filtering, drag and drop, automatic actions and subtasks, attachments and comments.

Can be great for walk-by monitoring. Recommended by w1llynilly, who says, `It has 2 pages by default for metrics about the OS and the network It is very lightweight and was recommended to me when I was looking for BGInfo alternatives.` True Ping is exactly the same as the standard ping program of Windows 9x, NT and 2000—except that it does a better job calculating the timing. It uses a random buffer (that changes at every ping) to improve performance. Thanks to bcahill for this one, who says, it `... can send pings very fast (hundreds per second). This is very helpful when trying to diagnose packet loss. It very quickly shows if packet loss is occurring, so I can make changes and quickly see the effect.` Parted Magic is a hard disk management solution that includes tools for disk partitioning and cloning, data rescue, disk erasing and benchmarking with Bonnie++, IOzone, Hard Info, System Stability Tester, mprime and stress. This standalone Linux operating system runs from a CD or USB drive, so nothing need be installed on the target machine. Recommended by Aggietallboy. mbuffer is a tool for buffering data streams that offers direct support for TCP-based network targets (IPv4 and IPv6), the ability to send to multiple targets in parallel and support for multiple volumes. It features I rate limitation, high- restart criteria, configurable buffer size and on-the-fly MD5 hash calculation in an efficient, multi-threaded implementation. Can help extend drive motor life by avoiding buffer underruns when writing to fast tape drives or libraries (those drives tend to stop and rewind in such cases). Thanks to zorinlynx, who adds, `If you move large streams from place to place, for example with `tar` or `zfs send` or use tape, mbuffer is awesome. You can send a stream over the network with a large memory buffer at each end so that momentary stalls on either end of the transfer don't reduce performance. This especially helps out when writing to tapes, as the tape drive can change directions without stopping the flow of data.` TeraCopy is a tool for copying files faster and more securely while preserving data integrity. Gives you the ability to pause file transfers, verify files after copy, preserve date timestamps, copy locked files, run a shell script on completion, generate and verify checksum files and delete files securely. Integrates with Windows Explorer. Suggested by DarkAlman to `replace the integrated Windows file copy utility. Much more stable, quicker transfers, crash tolerant and adds features like 'No-to-all' and 'yes-to-all' for comparing folders.` MultiDesk &amp; MultiDeskEnforcer are a combination of a tabbed remote desktop client (terminal services client) and a service that limits connections to only those that provide the correct shared secret (keeps hackers from accessing your server via RDP even if they have the correct password). Suggested by plazman30 as being `[s]imilar to Microsoft's RDP Manager, [b]ut doesn't need to be installed and has tabs across the top, instead of the side.` The PsTools suite includes command-line utilities for listing the processes running on local or remote computers, running processes remotely, rebooting computers, dumping event logs, and more. FYI: Some anti-virus scanners report that one or more of the tools are infected with a `remote admin` virus. None of the PsTools contain viruses, but they have been used by viruses, which is why they trigger virus notifications. Mosh is a remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of user keystrokes. It can be a more robust and responsive replacement for interactive SSH terminals. Available for GNU BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome and iOS. Suggested by kshade_hyaena, who likes it `for sshing while your connection is awful.` HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client designed for easy debugging and interaction with HTTP servers, RESTful APIs and web services. Offers an intuitive interface, JSON support, syntax highlighting, wget-like downloads, plugins, and more—Linux, macOS, and Windows support. Suggested by phils_lab as `like curl, but for humans.` LibreNMS is a full-featured network monitoring system. Supports a range of operating systems including Linux, FreeBSD, as well as network devices including Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, Foundry, HP and others. Provides automatic discovery of your entire network using CDP, FDP, LLDP, OSPF, BGP, SNMP and ARP; a flexible alerting system; a full API to manage, graph and retrieve data from your install and more. TheDraimen recommends it `if you cant afford a monitoring suite.` Tftpd64 is an open-source, IPv6-ready application that includes DHCP, TFTP, DNS, SNTP and Syslog servers and a TFTP client. Both client and server are fully compatible with TFTP option support (tsize, blocksize, timeout) to allow maximum performance when transferring data. Features include directory facility, security tuning and interface filtering. The included DHCP server offers unlimited IP address assignment. Suggested by Arkiteck: `Instead of Solarwinds TFTP Server, give Tftpd64 a try (it's FOSS).` Tree Style Tab is a Firefox add-on that allows you to open tabs in a tree-style hierarchy. New tabs open automatically as `children` of the tab from which they originated. Child branches can be collapsed to reduce the number of visible tabs. Recommended by Erasus, who says, `being a tab hoarder, having tabs on the left side of my screen is amazing + can group tabs.` AutoIt v3 is a BASIC-like scripting language for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. It automates tasks through a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window manipulation. Appreciated by gj80, who says, `I've built up 4700 lines of code with various functions revolving around global hotkeys to automate countless things for me, including a lot of custom GUI stuff. It dramatically improves my quality of life in IT.` MTPuTTY (Multi-Tabbed PuTTY) is a small utility that lets you wrap an unlimited number of PuTTY applications in a single, tabbed interface. Lets you continue using your favorite SSH client—but without the trouble of having separate windows open for each instance. XeroPoints recommends it `if you have a lot of ssh sessions.` ElastiFlow is a network flow data collection and visualization tool that uses the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana). Offers support for Netflow v5 sFlow and IPFIX flow types (1.x versions support only Netflow v5 Kindly recommended by slacker87. SpaceSniffer is a portable tool for understanding how folders and files are structured on your disks. It uses a Treemap visualization layout to show where large folders and files are stored. It doesn't display everything at once, so data can be easier to interpret, and you can drill down and perform folder actions. Reveals things normally hidden by the OS and won't lock up when scanning a network share. Graylog provides an open-source Linux tool for log management. Seamlessly collects, enhances, stores, and analyzes log data in a central dashboard. Features multi-threaded search and built-in fault tolerance that ensures distributed, load-balanced operation. Enterprise version is free for under 5GB per day. Ultimate Boot CD boots from any Intel-compatible machine, regardless of whether any OS is installed on the machine. Allows you to run floppy-based diagnostic tools on machines without floppy drives by using a CDROM or USB memory stick. Saves time and enables you to consolidate many tools in one location. Thanks to stick-down for the suggestion. MFCMAPI is designed for expert users and developers to access MAPI stores, which is helpful for investigation of Exchange and Outlook issues and providing developers with a sample for MAPI development. Appreciated by icemerc because it can `display all the folders and the subfolders that are in any message store. It can also display any address book that is loaded in a profile.` USBDeview lists all USB devices currently or previously connected to a computer. Displays details for each device—including name type, serial number (for mass storage devices), date it was added, VendorID, ProductID, and more. Allows you to disable USB devices, uninstall those that were previously used and disconnect the devices currently connected. Works on a remote computer when logged in as an admin. Thanks to DoTheEvolution for the suggestion. WSCC - Windows System Control Center will install, update, execute and organize utilities from suites such as Microsoft Sysinternals and Nirsoft Utilities. Get all the tools you want in one convenient download! Launchy is a cross-platform utility that indexes the programs in your start menu so you can launch documents, project files, folders and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes. Suggested by Patrick Langendoen, who tells us, `Launchy saves me clicks in the Win10 start menu. Once you get used to it, you begin wondering why this is not included by default.` Terminals is a secure, multi-tab terminal services desktop client that's a complete replacement for the mstsc.exe (Terminal Services) client. Uses Terminal Services ActiveX Client (mstscax.dll). Recommended by vermyx, who likes it because `the saved connections can use saved credential profiles, so you only have to have your credentials in one place.` Captura is a flexible tool for capturing your screen, audio, cursor, mouse clicks and keystrokes. Features include mixing audio recorded from microphone and speaker output, command-line interface, and configurable hotkeys. Thanks to jantari for the recommedation.

687106,$13.5K in CC debt. New job at $75K. ~200 point credit score drop in a year.,"The story is, I had around $5K in CC debt in January, when I quit my job because I hated it. I'm decently qualified for my industry and working on a few master's degrees. I figured I could get a job fairly quickly, and could live off of the money I had saved. I didn't adjust my lifestyle, thinking that my unemployment was going to be short. Eventually, I gave up looking in favor of Uber and holding out for a more specific job. From May-ish to September, I began struggling to pay my bills, and consistently missed payments on everything but my student loans, which I put into deferment. I finally started a job in the first week of September in the industry I want to work in, and my take home each month is $4,837.

The Rift-S will probably be $350, or if we're lucky $300, during the Black Friday sale in November. If you're dead-set on a budget graphics card and pcvr, this is probably the one you want since it was designed to offer the best experience on lower-end PCs. The benefit to the HTC Vive is the controller tracking system, but by Black Friday rolls around Rift-S's system will likely be substantially better than it is now since it is something they're continually working on. Finally, there is no 4GB version of a GTX 1060. Are you referring to the 3GB or 6GB version? VR games are a lot more demanding on your computer's hardware than ordinary games, especially when it comes to vram, so I would not at all recommend the 3GB version.

1621798,"on Computing RGB value for pcd format given r, g, b (Python)?","What is happening at that site is the following:r,g and b are defined as uint_8, integers represented with 8 bits. but the singular value rgb is a uint_32, an integer with 32 bits. Now, if you wanted to add r g and b, you would need to shift their values in the bit representation, just so they would not overlap. For instance:(uint_32)r &lt;&lt; 16; converts the value at r to a 32 bit representation and then shifts its content 16 positions to the left. Say your red value is 190. That is 10111110. Converting it to a 32 bit representation will add 24 0s at the left: 00000000 00000000 00000000 10111110. And then applying &lt;&lt;16 will shift it 16 bits to the left, giving you 00000000 10111110 00000000 00000000 . If you do that to the blue value,(which is, say, 40, 00101000 in binary) but shifting it only 8 bits, you get (uint_32)b &lt;&lt; 8; : 00000000 00000000 00101000 00000000Shifting 0 bits the green value converted to 32 bits gives you the same green value: 00000000 00000000 00000000 10000000 (g would be 128 here, or 1000000). You now have your 3 r g b representations in 32 bits. Notice that if you line them up, you can add them and then separate them without loss of data! That is done by the | operator, which just goes bit to bit and puts a 1 if any of the operands is 1, or 0 otherwise. Your end result will be 00000000 10111110 00101000 10000000 with your first 8 bits being unused, the second 8 bits being red, the third green, and the last, blue. If you convert this value to a float, you get a singular value representation of your rgb values.The fancy C++ stuff here is that shifting a binary number by N bits is equivalent to multiply that value in decimal by 2^N. Therefore, what it is happening here is single_value = 2^16*R + 2^8*G + 2^0 * B = 65536 * R + 256*G + B This is the value that pcd uses. Additionally, to go the other way around, you just need to decompose your value into R G B. In python this is easy:R = rgb B = (rgb - R*2**16) G = rgb - R*2**16 - G * 2**8 Again, in C++ they do this faster and way more fancier with bit shifting and bitwise operations",None,comments,computervision

Follow the ideas set out in the Running Order of Operations? Do something else entirely? Full version Apologies for the lengthy post, but I'm hoping that a high-quality question will help somebody else answer a similar question in the long run! I'm a 33 year-old male, and I'll be finishing Couch to 5K soon. I expect to finish the programme running for 30 minutes at roughly a 5:40 (9:07 pace. I've done a little running in the past, as well as a couple of sprint triathlons, but I've never taken fitness seriously until now. A poor diet and many years of sitting behind a desk left me depressed, unfit, overweight and deeply unhappy; but things are changing rapidly! Since I started C25K it feels like I've really turned my life around, so I'm keen to keep moving forward and improving once I'm done with the programme, and some structure will really help me to keep making progress. I don't have any specific goals yet, other than remaining injury-free and continuing to get fitter and shifting more weight as I go along. I also plan to incorporate swimming into my routine when the pools open again here in the UK, because it's the sport I'm naturally best at, and I've found in the past that swimming works well for active recovery. I may also add some cycling at some later stage, but running is the focus for now as it's the easiest of the three sports to fit into my schedule. I know that this question gets asked a lot in various different guises, and from scouring previous posts there is no real consensus on what might be best for me to do after I'm done with C25K. I think that my options are pretty much: &#x200B;  Bridge to 10K, although this has some conflicting reviews. Some people say the volume increases too quickly and it's a recipe for injury, others say that introducing walking intervals again feels horrible, but it's recommended here on the r wiki. Hal Higdon's plans, which are recommended fairly often (the 10K Novice plan in particular). I like the idea of doing runs of different lengths on different days, and it also looks like it would give me an easy way to incorporate swimming and cycling into my routine. However, at only 8 weeks long it is quite a short programme, which will leave me with this same question in 8 weeks time! Also, it's aimed at people who want to do a 10K race, and I don't have any particular interest in racing... at least not yet! Following the principles set out in the Running Order of Operations resource. This suggests that I should slowly increase the number of times I'm running 5K from 3-4 times per week up to 5-7 times per week to start with, followed by increasing the distance of 2-3 runs per week. This seems simple enough to follow, with the major benefit of lasting me a good long while. However, it feels like there isn't a lot of variety initially, and running 5K that often may get monotonous. I'd also need to consider how to incorporate swimming and cycling into my routine. Something else entirely! Is there anything I'm missing? Would you recommend something I haven't come across yet?  &#x200B; Having some structure really helps me with my discipline, so any inspiration from the community would be much appreciated! Thanks for reading. Next on the agenda: buying some new shoes to replace my decade-old 768s, and joining my local running club!",/u/jND2x-3Qsk_5s7b,summary,running

3509077,Personal Protective Equipment Discussion?,"I am by no means an expert. I own maybe two of the things I list on here. But, I thought I’d brainstorm some PPE out loud and get some feedback. I’ll leave body armour out of this: primarily because I have zero knowledge about it, and secondarily because I think it is too specialized of a subject and not everyone the world over would have access to it.  I think the ideal situation would be using your wits to avoid being in a situation that requires PPE in the first place. This means knowing local travel routes, local news, and generally staying out of harms way wherever you can have prior knowledge, unless you are fully equipped and have a tangible goal in mind. That being said, we try to prepare for the possible, even though it’s improbable. Head: Basic would be a simple baseball hat or beanie depending on the weather. A rock climbing helmet, construction helmet would be the next step up. High level protection can be had by motorcycling helmets. Out of all these, I think construction helmets are something that are within the reach of most people around the world. Am I saying that we should be bugging out in a hard-hat? No. But certain situations would call for it. Example: you have to rescue someone from a building after an earthquake when existing EMS are stretched thin. Eyes: Safety glasses run under $10 at hardware stores. They’re not the most comfortable, but if you’re on a budget, they’re better than nothing. They will also prevent (to a degree) pathogens entering your body through the eye (exposed mucous membrane) if you’re providing first aid on a trauma patient. A step up would be ballistic sunglasses (I’m personally looking for recommendations on these; not because I shoot but because I think they’d provide decent protection in an emergency without looking dorky). I guess something that provides a full seal around the eye would be the highest on this list. Like snow goggles, military sand goggles. Respiration: A simple bandana or handkerchief is cheap, easy to carry, and would filter out most large debris. Step up to N95 masks. 3M makes a number of full and half face respirators with interchangeable filters for a variety of particulates. I don’t have experience with any of them but feel free to check out their catalogue here if you want. If you have the money, it’d be easy to get carried away here. Neck: Buff or scarf. Weather protection and good for making yourself anonymous at a distance or in a similarly dressed crowd if you find yourself in a riot. Torso: I don’t think this area is concern unless you’re expecting to get into a violent confrontation (in which case look into military grade body armour). But, there are motorcycle gear companies that make standalone and insertable body armour. A more useful dressing for this area of body would be a reflective safety vest (under $15 at local hardware store). Being seen and identifiable by others when you have first responder skills is good. If you have a mutual assistance group, you have stock up on these. As your group identifies others that are able to help, you have give these to them so the whole group becomes easy to sight by people looking for help in a large scale disaster. Also good if you find yourself in a low-vis environment (snowstorm, dust-storm, etc) or search and rescue situation in a rural area (as a searcher or searchee). Hands: Good cold weather gloves so you can avoid going numb and maintain fine motor skills. Also consider hard use leather work gloves, fireproof flight gloves, and industrial grade chemical resistant gloves.  Foot protection: I think a broken in pair of running shoes are essential to always have closeby. If you drive, you can switch out of your dress shoes boots and walk home faster if you need to. For rescue efforts, consider getting a pair of steel toe shoes or boots (I prefer shoes because they’re easier to run in). Step up from your regular shoes by investing and breaking in a pair of hiking type. Traction accessories like Kahtoola and Yaktrax would be useful if you live anywhere it snows.

Heres what i did, DO at your own risk as updates are meant to be a normal part of windows. Also Windows Store won't be able to download apps if updates are disabled.  EDIT: before to disable you may need to right-click the service and select Stop also once disable is selected and you click OK a restart maybe needed to take affect.  Here's how you would Start the service back up again so you can download an app or update your PC you would also return here to Stop it. You can't just select stop to turn off updates permanently you need to do the first step and disable it , if its not disabled in services it will be turned back on after a reboot.",None,subs,windows
363932,Would it be appropriate for a nurse to attend grand rounds or medical lectures at a teaching hospital?,"A few days ago we admitted a 63 y female with suspected ischemic bowel. She presented with bloody stools, HTN with systolics in the 180's dry heaves, and pain in her lower left quadrant. Past medical history was sparse, but I did receive information during report of occasional PVC's and sinus tach in the low 100's.  While I cared for her, the plan was to observe while maintaining fluids, abx, and lowering her pain. She was given LR @100, vanc, cipro, Tylenol IV, Phenergan 6.25 PRN , zofran 8mg PRN, and fentanyl Q3. Not a ton of drips, but I definitely found myself in her room quite a bit trying to play catch up with her ever increasing nausea, pain, and dry heaves. The family was becoming frustrated at the lack of interventions as this was the weekend and our teams were cross covering. What struck me personally was just how helpless I felt in caring for this patient. Beyond just throwing meds at watching vitals, I had no way of understanding the entirety of her pathology beyond what my `touchy feely` nursing school taught us.  Of course, I tried my best to jump in her room whenever I saw the surgical residents to get a better idea of her plan. However, the team was always slammed with patients to really give me any idea of what was happening. One of the residents mentioned that keeping her blood pressure somewhat elevated would increase her perfusion in the ischemic area, and in my mind I just kept thinking, `Makes sense, but why exactly? Is giving hydralazine 10mg appropriate in this case?`. It hit me when I got home that I really want to learn beyond what our hospital is willing to educate new nurses on. What is surprising is that, even being in a top 10 hospital does not afford to educate new nurses beyond feel good `residencies` that at most teach you EMR systems and how to be `caring`. I want hard hitting pathology! I want to understand from established providers why I am performing these interventions in relation to hospital policy! In this way I can collaborate with the providers as a team member instead of just nodding my head and going along. During one of our Mickey Mouse seminars, I saw all the medical students and residents going into a different lecture hall and cracked the door slightly to listen in. I would love to sit in on rounds or lectures on my days off to just to expand and push myself towards the top of what my license allows me to do. Would this be appropriate for someone like me to inquire about? Or is it more of a closed door type of thing?  Edit: I'm really happy to have woken up to this! I didn't think this post would get much traction! I'm fortunate in that I work with a lot of the med-students on my floor, so perhaps when I go into work I can ask who I need to speak to!  And I also wanted to say Thank You to everyone who has sent me PM's and comments encouraging me to seek higher education based on this post! I've never considered it, but perhaps medical school or CRNA will be in my future!",None,subs,medicine
1807685,Its been three weeks.,"Its been challenging but worth it I’m especially proud of myself because i injured myself at work and still fought my urges even though i knew it would numb my pain. I have been smoking heavily since i was 15 its been 11 years I’ve been numbing my emotions with drinking and smoking. Now that I’ve been sober i realize i hate my job and just stay there because it pays really well and i can do it stoned. I realized how can i find my passion if i numb every emotion I have. I want to learn how to play guitar and how to touch type, things i alway put off cause i would just get high and watch movies. I need to start dealing with my emotions which isn’t easy i feel myself thinking about things i never dealt with. I grew up in a poor neighborhood and had close friends murdered starting in 8th grade, again in 10th, and in my sophomore year in college. I never even let myself cry i would just smoke it all away. But i know all the sadness i feel dealing with those emotions is nothing like the sadness i knew i was bringing on myself holding myself back with drugs. Being in a legal state its hard theres literally billboards everywhere for weed delivery. But i told a gram of wax it was the devil and i want it out my life before throwing it in a dumpster.

I don't have any real medical issues and I don't use drugs of any sort. It's when I turn my head too quick or accidentally in a weird way it feels like something pops, tears or breaks inside my head (the back of it, right above the neck) and then a warm sensation spreads around that area, like fluid. Kind of like a volcanic outbreak and the lava that follows. Or like cracking an unusually hot, raw egg on the inside of my head. It hurts but not insanely much, just enough to make me curse when it happens but not enough to make me cry. The pain and everything is over in a couple of minutes and it's just back to normal. No dizziness or blurry vision. No other symptoms at all. I've tried to explain this to others when it happens as `ouch, I just cracked my brain` haha but nobody seems to get what I describe. Does anyone know what this is? I'm thinking it has to be pretty harmless since it's happened a lot and I haven't had any real issues but the warm spread is concerning me a bit. It feels like fluid so I'm concerned that it would be blood or something. But then again, why does it get so warm and where does the warmth come from?

I have always been a shy person, been really subtle to people that I like and never been with a girl before. Last Thursday I super liked a girl on tinder, I really liked everything about her, also her views about the world (what she wrote in her bio). She liked me later that night and we started talking and soon switched to a different platform. Since that day we talked every day to each other. Not flirting but just asking each other questions and having a genuine conversation. On Tuesday I asked her out and she said yes. We agreed on Sunday but continued to talk every day since. Then today she messaged me and asked if I'd rather meet today because she was free. I said fuck it, not like I would be less nervous tomorrow. We met in a cafe, talked for hours and we immediately clicked. The cafe closed and we travelled around the city to find a place to eat, we ordered food and ate from the same plate. Then we went to the park and swinged (which I have not done since my childhood) and continued to talk. I said I really like her to which she replied with `I do too`. Then I walked her home and we hugged. We where together for 7 hours and had an awesome time! On my way home she messaged me and told me she really enjoyed her time with me. We have agreed to meet again next week! What I am trying to say from this post is, there is always hope. I have never connected this quickly with a person before. Everything clicked. And my biggest tip is, be yourself, pretending to be someone else will not help! She will like you how you are!!

8403838,What is the purpose of this subreddit ?,"As an amateur it makes me laugh so much. In reality, I have a real job that allows me to live comfortably. So I don't understand this obsession for the dev's community to... well, to take out a finished thing and SELL it. Like... in other creative circles, there is no such obsession. When a guy is painting on Sundays, he's advised to learn the basics of drawing... But you don't get on those high horses if he wants to do the Sistine Chapel in his living room or a little shitty painting. My wife is a writer and has already published (and she had a real profession that brings in the pittance). She is on writer's forums. There are often people who come to say that they want to write an epic novel in 10 volumes with a hundred characters. Here, there are two choices. Either the guy writes these 10 volumes in his corner without any other ambition to write and ... ok, why not. He's part of the community and it's all about things and others about the aspect of writing. Either he tells everyone that he's going to be the next Harry Potter, in which case, yes, he's advised to start with short stories first. But the goal in itself of these creative groups, especially at the amateur level where we do our own work on Sunday afternoons... It's just to exchange on what brings us closer. Among the gamedevs there is really no such thing. It's always about success, failure, finishing a game, the best strategy to become a multimillionaire. Whereas honestly... most of the `pro` who post... well, sometimes they shouldn't have released their game (here, it's the player who speaks).  So, you know a place where we just `talk` about our hobbies, how proud we are because we implemented a feature and that's it? Because honestly, this subreddit, I wonder what it's for. I have a thousand times more fun reading the subreddit `game design` where the community is top-notch, we're just talking about game design, how to implement this or that game rule and that's all. There isn't this aggressiveness of the pros (because their life is hard and all that…), no disguised ads, no artists who want to promote themselves by offering free samples, no youtube tutorials repeating advice already discussed by Brakeys and so on.  Because as an amateur, I don't care about success. I put money into my project like I could put it in my car or in a tennis racket. And... I hesitate to write it... But really, I don't care if the life of a pro is so difficult. In fact, I know, that's why I didn't take any training related to video games. Just like I know that being a professional photographer is hard. But that's not going to stop me from taking pictures and posting them on my facebook. PS : And if I have to go completely against the tide: I even think that the players as a whole should be encouraged to make games, even the most ambitious games possible. Just to teach them how it's hard. No, it's not so easy to add this feature in a game they like. No, a patch is not enough to make a broken game playable.  I mean... That's kind of what happens in other arts. Fans of a rock band, they'll get a guitar and sing their favorite song. And that's good. Some will stop, some will continue, and make their own song, learn music theory and maybe some of them will become professionals.",/u/Molina_Eco,summary,gamedev

5743366,Questions about the RR routines philosophy. Some conflict with my knowledge that i gained from when i used to lift,"Long story short, I used to go to the gym weight training 5x a week(compound exercises, hit every muscle group twice except once only in legs). I got great results. That was a few years ago and all my gains are practically gone. I still have some muscle but i'm like 18% bf. 165 lbs at 5'8 ish. Okay, so some things i want to ask. I gained all my knowledge from weight lifting from channels like eliot hulse(he was really good when he was active years back), hodgetwins, and now jeremy ethier. I really like jeremy ethier, he is my favorite. He bases his videos from what seem to be quality studies(albeit i haven't checked every video and read every study he references, so i could bew rong about him). &#x200B; Here are some things that seem to conflict with what is circulating on this subreddit. Please correct me on any misinformation I have, and if it varies because bodyweight vs weight lifting is different. There is a lot of information in the FAQ and RR page so this is my way of quickly understanding things.  1) More sets = more growth. 10-20 sets per week for a particular muscle group. Does the routines above achieve this for lets say back, and chest? legs? 3x8 splits 3x a week is a little underwhelming no?  2) If you want to maximize growth in a muscle group, lets say chest, you would focus on the compound exercise and do it first. But in this routine, it seems like what I would start doing is planks for 10minutes(with rests) and then into rows and diamond pushups 3x8. Wouldn't doing planks make it harder for me to do the pushps?  3) Why are weighted vests bad? If I have a 40lbs weighted vest, wouldn't it be better to do that with normal pushups than doing diamond pushups? Normal pushups are way too easy for me. Aren't diamond pushups harder because it utilizes more triceps over chest? Is this truly the fastest way to build muscle in a bodyfitness environment? I know the evidence for weighted vests is weak, but that could just be due to a lack of attention. COuld someone clarify on this one for me please? I have 12lbs vest and 40lbs.  4) Longer rests &gt; shorter rests if the muscle demand is present. So lets say i have a 50 lbs vest, and i do that for 5 sets and 3 minutes rest inbetween sets, would this be inferior to doing diamond pushups with 90sceconds rest inbetween?  Let me know if i didn't articulate well enough. Thanks!",/u/Myn3pon,summary,bodyweightfitness

6489209,"on How to teach a class that students consider ""useless""","Well my buddy is a PhD student teaching freshmen their intro to professional communications class. His process is to provide clear, useful experiences (e.g. prepare a report on this issue, write a sourced opinion paper on this event, etc.), gives them feedback on how to improve, and says `fuck 'em` if they say it's useless.  He's still the arbiter of their grades. If you can't do some mindless, seemingly useless work they're not gunna get far in the workforce. Even the best jobs have boring paper work.  The second approach is probably prepare homeworks, exams, and projects that revolve around the application of concepts. For instance for DeMorgan's law provide them with an example logical problem and have them provide the most efficient implementation of a logic function which covers all cases (this is pretty obviously useful in CS). You might also consider looking at higher level ideas which can be broken down into parts for your syllabus. By the time they implement the higher level concept they understand the lower-level ones and magically they have a useful experience and some domain knowledge. BUT in reality I would recommend the feelings echoed elsewhere here. Fuck 'em if they think it's useless. It's not. At the end of the day your job is to teach them concepts. If they don't want to do that work that's their problem and their grade will reflect that.  Good on you for finding a way to reach out to your students and maybe spark a deeper interest in mathematics but at the end of the day it depends on how motivated they are.

822410,[D] Go Explore VS Sonic the Hedgehog,"Mirror:  Here is my first great result after about 30 hours of running Go Explore with one thread on my desktop with an i7 3930k. The best tool assisted human made world record I could find is at 24 seconds, so still slightly better than my result, but it takes almost the exact same path. Cells were defined by taking floor( (sonic's location) ), and fitness is defined as the fewest number of frames to reach the cell. So if during exploration sonic reaches any cell using a shorter trajectory, that trajectory replaces the previous trajectory to reach that cell. The major change I made was to use something a little better than random exploration, and also to add another greedier go explore routine that I call a comb. First I used a convolutional model which predicted action probabilities to sample from based on screen input which was trained on some of the best trajectories found so far. This seemed to slow down overall progress too much. A super lightweight markov chain on only actions (blind to the screen and game state) worked the best so far. Meeting somewhere in the middle will probably be optimal. The 'comb':Once go explore has found a winning trajectory, occasionally a comb will be done. Instead of go(random), I execute go(state) for each state visited in the winning trajectory in order. This focuses on finding a good speedrun instead of just exploring everywhere randomly, and also causes improvements to be immediately exploited more. Usually when a cell trajectory is improved it takes a while before that trajectory is used for further improvements. But if a cell in the speedrun is improved it will immediately get exploited once the comb reaches the cell that has been improved. Code is currently a pretty dirty python notebook that stores the whole database in a shelf and only ever works on one thing at a time. Plans are to rewrite something that can run at scale on AWS and attempt a complete run of super mario brothers instead and then maybe release code if there isn't a better go explore out by then.",None,subs,MachineLearning
5824100,Why do I drastically lose and gain my appetite for weeks at a time?,"I frequently will lose my appetite for around 3 weeks at a time. Most foods then don’t interest me, or if they do then I eat them and don’t enjoy the process of eating. I barely eat during these times if I’m honest, I usually have dinner since my mum cooks it for me but I often don’t finish it and then will only snack during the day, if at all, since I don’t have the desire to eat. On the opposite side, when I have my appetite back I can eat quite a lot. I feel like I’m never full (or never satisfied) and have really strong cravings for certain foods. I guess this is to make up for the weeks I wasn’t eating very much.  This is really bothering me because I’m very skinny and I’m trying to gain weight and muscle, but the periods of time where I don’t want to eat are probably having an impact. I don’t actually lose weight I don’t think, at least not drastically, but it’s definitely not helping me to put any on. When I was around 12 (I’m 17 now) I had a few years where my relationship with food was bad and I would purposefully not eat. This wasn’t a huge deal physically but now I’m thinking maybe it’s linked to losing my appetite now? I’m not really sure what to do. I’m over that and I literally WANT to gain weight now, so could that really be affecting it?",/u/JmoonlightD,summary,medical
6421770,"Holy Crap, I Did It! I Hit My Goal Weight!!! 8 months of steady subtle changes!","I finally saw that first digit say 1. I weigh 197 baby! I actually made it under 200 lbs! I can’t believe it! Now for my story... Let me start by saying I’m no expert. This worked for me. It may not be for everyone. There are many different roads to take on your journey. I’m just sharing mine.  I made the decision that on Jan 1 2020 I’d start making efforts to lose weight. I didn’t know what those efforts would be at the time, I honestly didn’t know how to lose weight... but I knew I was ready to change. I was that “skinny fat” where most people wouldn’t call me fat, but not call me skinny either. I’d just get occasional comments that would remind me I wasn’t in good shape, and it’d hurt my feelings a little. More importantly, I wasn’t fitting my clothes well, and I was just feeling kinda crappy all the time. It was time for a change. I weighed myself on my moms scale at Christmas, and saw the number tick up to 245 lbs. I knew that after the holidays, it was time. Change #1: I used to always eat fast food for lunch at work. It was an excuse to get out of the office, and also I was just too lazy to meal prep. I made efforts to eat my own food, but I was inconsistent. Over the first couple months of the year, I found something that worked... Healthy Choice Cafe Steamers. They were delicious, and it allowed me to live my life the same way... not preparing food. I just would keep a stock of the frozen meals for the week. Super easy.  Change #2: I gave up soda... this was the hard one. And probably the catalyst to my weight loss. In early March, I happened to go two days without drinking pop. Specifically Mountain Dew, my go to drink. I felt like crap. I was having headaches and withdrawals from the lack of sugar and caffeine. I knew I was either going to drink one, or tough it out and give it up completely. And I gave it up for good. This was the hardest part. That first week of no soda really sucked. But it got easier after that. Right now I primarily drink water and skim milk (less now though). The more I got used to water, the better and better it tasted. I also recommend a Britta filter. Cheap and easy.  Change #3: I started counting calories. I realized just how many calories the lack of soda and fast food were saving me. I became curious. I wanted to see data. So I decided to use the LoseIt app. I quickly realized that I was eating relatively well now. But I also learned what portions worked, and what foods were sneakily high in calories (curse you cereal). But overall I was losing weight now. Tracking these calories really started the domino effect of changes: I started eating better foods now. More veggies. Smaller portions. I learned so much. And the data matched with the results. I bought a scale in May and saw I was down to 222. I then started weighing daily. It fluctuated a lot (water weight is totally a thing), but ultimately it trended downwards. Change #4: Exercise! I hate going to the gym. It sucks. It’s boring. I want to do literally anything else! I had to find a way to exercise in a way that I enjoyed. I found 2 great methods. First is the Oculus Quest. Virtual reality workouts are so fun and work up one hell of a sweat. I could burn about 500 calories in a half hour session. It was awesome. Second is bike riding. This is seasonal (Midwest winters suck), but once it got warm I started riding a few times a week. I started going a few miles, and slowly worked my way up. I’m now going 15-30 miles on my general rides, and I absolutely love it. You can burn tons of calories bike riding, and there are zero downsides to it. I highly recommend it! These changes were all subtle. They all started small. They all started at different times in the year. I didn’t wake up one morning doing all of these things at once. I made progress and strides in the right direction. Now I’m going to continue to lose until I hit about 185. Then after that, I will learn maintenance. The way I’m eating and living is great. I can do this forever! This is possible and sustainable. I eat foods I like. I eat carbs. I eat sugar (much less than before lol). I just portion it correctly.",/u/ofbrun,summary,loseit

8145270,"Comparison of Pavlov, Contractors, and Onward For FPS fans that are interested.","Graphics - Contractors&gt;onward&gt;pavlov......pavlov is blocky and simple. Onward looks better... but runs worse for 90% of people i play with... Contractors has much better looking maps and player models (on pc) (sans pavlovs admittedly cool gore option) than either... though some say they have an `artificial` look to them. i believe this is because it has a very bright color scheme. Think battlefield 3. It looks great.. but a little bright and colorful. Gunplay - Contractors&gt;onward&gt;pavlov......pavlovs guns are shit, sorry not sorry... . It uses a counter-strike ripped `spray pattern` which makes very little sense in VR. It feels like everyone is an inexperienced shooter holding the gun with their fingertips. No joke i've seen people get kicked out of gun ranges for shooting like people do in pavlov. Its the only game where bullets can seemingly come out at an angle from your barrel... Honestly baffles me how people think `spray patterns` are a good thing..... Onward's guns are the opposite... They have only vertical recoil... meaning almost every gun can be precision aimed... leaving no real need for snipers and other weapons. Contractors is a mix of both. Some spray... but kept relatively on target and mostly vertical, with a greater degree of focus on head shots than either other game. Time to kill. - contractors&gt;pavlov&gt;Onward....Contractors has the HIGHEST ttk in the game... ***for new players***... because it has different levels of armor and matters more where you hit especially if using a low dmg weapon... So heavy armor slows you down but you can take 5 body shots from a low damage weapon or maybe 3 shots from high damage weapon long range wearing heavey armor. This is however offset by head shots always remaining 1 shot kills, any weapon, by having different areas of the body do different amounts of dmg and by weapons not handling like a wet noodle like in Pavlov, leading to landing more shots in general so the ttk isnt really that much higher in the end once you stop spray and preying like in pavlov and learn to land your shots. -pavlov has health like contractors... but standard armor... So expect like 2-4 shots to kill. generally ttk on pavlov is faster than contractors... but only if your landing every shot which is near impossible without memorizing the stupid bullets spray pattern or using every gun single shot. if you take bullet spray into account id say they are about the same. Pavlov `pros` will kill fast due to memorizing spray patterns (how rEaLiStiC!) or more likely by using semi-auto to land more shots, and contractor pros will kill faster due to their actual aiming accuracy, using controlled fire, and aiming for vital areas. which brings me to how in pavlov you can buy helmets meaning head shots arn't always 1 shot kill like in contractors. -onward is basically hardcore mode... Gone is recoil inaccuracy in exchange for tons of damage. you'll be quite surprised if you ever have to shoot again to finish an enemy unless your using a pistol or you missed. 1-2 bullets from 90% of guns kill. This combined with very accurate weapons with NO horiztonal drift and only vertical recoil means most engagements only last a few shots, and most players rarely miss. This turns the gameplay into a kind of `who saw who first` as there is almost never a chance to do something like take cover and return fire. So TTK is super low.. and you'll spend most of your time creeping around looking for the enemy than actually shooting at them. Most people compare onward to arma.. but i feel like its more like super hardcore milsim VR laser tag because of how insanely accurate and dmging every gun is. Game modes- Tie between contractors and pavlov.... pavlov has more game modes in total (or used to... havnt counted lately and contractors got a ton with the recent updates) and more `exotic` game modes, things like Trouble in terrorist town and battle royal....Contractors has more of the traditional game modes though. but it does lack the things like TTT, but personally i've always found pavlovs custom modes very janky... Like they have a Battle royal and it `works` but its janky.....Onward has the best PVE of any of them... but thats not saying much... Its definitely worth it if you like slow 1 shot, 1 life game modes... and co-op modes. because thats all it has... and the devs are actively against adding modes like TDM or anything... and nobody plays the assault game mode because its poorly done. If your just buying it for the multiplayer PVE i'd argue zero calibur or something else might be better. Though it does stand on its PVE alone and has its one PVP gamemode to boot. playercount - Pavlov&gt;onward=contractors......onward used to beat contractors and probably still does a bit but with contractors mods and updates bringing people back and cross play between quest and PC we've seen many more players. pavlov was first to market... first with mods... and first to get big streamers attention... costs only 10$ and will run on any vr capable pc like a dream (save alot of the un-optimized custom maps(not pavlovs fault))... so it has player count almost double of all others despite arguably being the worst of the three.... This is definitly one of those situations where its got so many players... solely because it has so many players. So if you cant enjoy a game unless its got 40 open lobbies at 4am on a wednesday... then maybe pavlov... But contractors and onward have about 10-20 lobbies almost constantly now. Performance - Pavlov&gt; contractors&gt; Onward......Pavlov wins this... Its graphics are so simple and blocky that it runs on anything that will run in VR. Onward looks slightly better and focuses more on realism.. but its performance has tanked as it has slowly upgraded its graphics. Contractors doesn't run as well as Pavlov... but far better than onward for most surprisingly... and arguably (depending on taste) looks better than either two... maps... Figured this one might be important to some... But its hard to straight rank..... all have good and bad maps. But i feel like contractors is designed to be `competitive`, pavlovs are designed to be `casual`, and onwards are designed to be `realistic`. This all goes out window with custom maps. Where as Pavlov has Counter-strike maps mainly and a lot of `my first level` stuff. Onward has..... well.. not much.... and contractors *so far* just has lots of insanely impressive Call of duty ports. With others to come.  I don't think yall have to guess which one i recommend purchasing.. but im Willing to answer any questions anyone has about any of the games. Edit: I should also mention contractors has more CRUCIAL vr options that cant be overstated like gunstock configuration, a good virtual stock, and weapon smoothing and the whole gammut of vr sickness aids.",/u/GuerrillaTactX,summary,oculus

Im scared and this sucks TT,"Im a 25M that is currently doing a license for aircraft, specifically helicopter, engineering I've been studying this since late 2013 so I've been in this industry for 7 ish year. Lately I've been having thoughts on my studies And just an hour ago its been weighing on my mind. I do not like this. I do not like this industry AT ALL. I asked myself, where do i see myself in 5 year ? Will i still be in this industry, will i come to an acceptance with it ? Etc etc. It went as far as me thinking, do i really need those high paying jobs ? I need money but really, moderation should be enough, right ? Provided i save up, invest and live in moderation, that should be enough, right ? I went in to this industry at first through my parents. My dad specifically. He wasn't keen on me continue studying cause its expensive and a waste of time so he thought that if i were to continue i might aswell continue on something that is high paying. One that can secure a stable life for me. Dont get me wrong, i wasnt forced on this. I listened, and i agreed. Overtime im learning after years and years, i find it hard to truly enjoy this. Its been noticeable for the past 2 year. And last night was the loudest. And it doesnt help that im not doing well in my studies aswell. Failed exams, lots of things to do still. Im looking at another year or two before i really finish and get my license. I dont want to stay in this industry anymore. But i also dont want to disappoint my parents. I guess what i want the most right now is a stable, permannet career. Albeit this day an age permanent job is hard to maintain. Im sick of living off of my parents allowances for the past 2 years. Why do i not get a job instead ? I cant. Im in the middle of a place where no one's hiring, not even part time and the nearest job i can find is downtown where the cost of transportation fee would consume atleast half of my job, if i were to find one. I am lost. I dont know what to do. What i want right now is a job, to earn money. But i also dont want to disappoint my parents after doing this for 7 years and quitting. I hate this. I hate feeling this way. I feel like i am not in control of my life. Have anyone else feel this way ? What did you guys do to cope with these thoughts and problem ? Im sorry if it is too long.

I started studying epilepsy as a master's student. I then shifted to fMRI and EEG of the reward pathway for my dissertation. And I now do alcohol use disorder research.  In science you want to be a well rounded researcher that specializes in research tools and techniques but also have a broad spectrum of other tool kits to help you answer your research questions. I truly believe this is the route to go but unfortunately, academia wants the researcher to have been born knowing that they wanted to cure cancer or develop a brain from corn and any deviation from that is not wanted. They expect you to have the knowledge of your field and topic that you have 10+ papers published but also know other areas with 5+ papers. These are numbers I am making up to communicate the emphasis on paper publications. But also have collaborations with other scientists. They want you to go to other universities for your degress but study the same topic using different tools.  See where the issue lies? It is very difficult to do this because of funding. You may want to go to Dr. Xs lab to study disease Y using tool Z but Prof X doesnt have money to have a trainee. So you miss out. Now you have to look at University A which is were you got your undergrad because there is no money to consider. Well only experiment money. But now that is a problem because you stayed at the same school. It gets complicated.  &#x200B; With that being said, there are opportunities to get all of this done which may involve you getting your own funding and your own money but that is a whole different AMA. So we'll stick to this thread.  Back to your question, it is okay to have a different undergrad major. I had a business major in my lab for 2 years because she wanted to expand her comfort zone of college life. As far as for grad school you will have to search the university you want to attend and see what courses they may require or what kind of experience. What I do know based on admission to a grad program, is that you want to be an exceptional student. Use your arts major to tell your story and how you would be an amazing research in whatever field you want to study.

Why this pregnancy is unwanted is for a few reasons: - the relationship has been strained for years. We wanted to break up two weeks ago, but my husband dreamed of my pregnancy and said he would do everything possible to save our relationship. His dream came true I guess. Just found out I'm pregnant.  For years we argued endlessly about everything. sex life has diminished because I no longer found him attractive after he had put on extremely much weight over the years. He's 34 and too young to let himself go like that. Lack of sex has alienated us more and more. Despite our common interests: we continued to drift apart. Two weeks ago I was ready to leave all of this behind and made up my mind But my partner has seemingly turned himself around. Exercises every day, thinks of his choice of words when he talks to me and is in a better mood even though I constantly block him off. I just don't know what to believe in. How long will this motivation last? My biggest conflict is that I am still in my studies. I've been studying for ages because of my kids. And now that my younger one is 3, I want to finally finish my studies. I'm 27 years old and don't want to start working at 35. With a third child, I will probably never finish my studies. I'm studying law and it's a miracle that I've made it this far. I got had a lot of support from the grandparents, but I still had to take a lot of breaks. The grandparents are unfortunately not there now. The grandpa died recently. Grandma moved away. My husband lost both parents at an early age. How am I supposed to do that with only 3 children? In addition, the dependency that I wanted to get out of for so long Will prolong. My husband earns very well, I only get student loans. I don't want to live forever at his expense, even if he doesn't blame me. But I want to finally finish my studies and find a way into independence .

In addition, I seem to prefer the small one (turn a blind eye because it is the smaller one etc). I think I made enough mistakes as a mother that another child would be beyond the limit of what I can handle.  I think now is just not the time, but how do I tell my partner? He won't accept that even if it's my choice. I know he'll blow up when I say the A word. He would NEVER agree to that. Sure it's my decision, but how should I explain to him that I won't keep the child.  I'm in the 4th week at most. Is there a way to arrange this with the doctor without him noticing anything? If I say I'll do it, he'll call me a murderer for the rest of my life. He's always been against it. And he longs for a third child for so long.

I would love to major in psychology, but I wouldn't know what career path to take. I wasn't planning on going to grad school, but I think I could take out some more loans if it comes down to it.

Not only would it improve the quality of my research output, it would also save hours and hours of my own time that I currently spend going through statistics textbooks and asking for help on forums like these! However, as things are, nobody really wants to admit that they struggle with statistics because academic jobs are insecure enough as it is without admitting a `weakness`.

9245388,"Laptop won't boot to internal hard drive, has connectivity issues, and I can't find a CMOS battery anywhere","Hello everyone. I've been working around various issues I've been having with my laptop, but on Thursday morning it suddenly wouldn't boot to the internal hard drive. I'll go into details regarding each issue I've been having to determine if they're related at all and what I need to do to solve these issues.  Specs: MSI GS65 Stealth laptop I haven't upgraded any internal components.  Issues: 1. Laptop won't boot to internal hard drive 2. Laptop has connectivity issues, but only when gaming online - connectivity at all other times is reliable. 3. Been having some issues recently with the time and date both in the operating systems on my laptop and in the UEFI. Tried to find a CMOS battery to replace, but I can't find one. If there is one, please help me find it.  Details:   No notable events seemed to have caused this issue. My battery was dead Thursday morning, so I plugged it in to the charger and waited a little before booting. It boots directly into UEFI. I checked all my settings and in the boot order lists `Hard Drive` though nothing specific beyond that. Laptop is capable of booting to Live USB. For reference, I have a dual boot setup and I usually access a grub menu that allows me to choose between Linux Mint 20.1 Cinnamon DE and Windows 10 Pro. Booted to a Live USB with Linux Mint 20.1 Cinnamon and interacted with some people in a Linux Help IRC channel. They gave me some pointers regarding what commands I can use in terminal to determine if there any issues with the partitions on my hard drive. I ran I believe lsbck -f to determine the partitions and ran fsck to check for issues. All partitions check out fine. I am able to browse the file systems and I backed up what files I wanted. The issue that I have is that I honestly think the issue is with the grub menu.  Ever since I got the laptop 1.5-2 years ago, I've had issues with playing online games at my home over wifi. When I take it elsewhere, it works fine, and when I run a double-NAT set up, it works over the other router but not the mesh router that runs through my home. If I hook up the laptop to the mesh routers with an ethernet cable, it works fine. It's only over wifi and it's purely through this router. I called and emailed eero support, but they were unable to determine any sort of issue on their end - no firewall blocking my access, nothing on their end seemed to be causing any sort of issue. I disabled all firewalls within Windows, but still no good. I allowed exceptions for the one game I was playing and Steam, but still no good. When I contacted MSI, they requested that I ship the laptop in and let them check it out. I determined that it wasn't a big enough problem for me to simply be without my laptop for an unknown period of time, so I've just been working with it. My guess is that it's an incompatibility with the wifi chip in my laptop and the eero router.  The date and time on my laptop keep resetting to 1 and 00:00:00 daily. I've been manually syncing with time servers in Windows as a slight work around. Tried to find a CMOS battery to replace, but I can't find one. If there is one, please help me find it.   Please help, and thank you.  Also, as a fun little side note - I tried posting this from my phone and it just kept giving me an error.

2330056,EM hits my car and blames me for drunk driving (long read beautiful ending),"I apologize but I am writing this on mobile yadayadayada sry for mistakes. So a little backstory I have a really nice grey land cruiser that looks like a monster truck and it costs a lot of money. (not because of the car itself but mostly the parts inside of it.) I live in a pretty good neighborhood but it happens to be right next to the most busy road in my area. Also I was underage when it comes to drinking so I have never had alcohol in my life unless I was at church. So let’s meet the cast... EM: horrifying excuse for a mom PK: poor kid not really playing a part in this story PO: police officer AKA my guardian angel Me: most lucky guy in the world Alright let’s start. So I get a message from my co-worker saying that there is a problem at work and I’d better come over. I work at a computer repair shop so if there’s a problem where they have to call me in it is usually a hundred or thousand dollar problem that requires most hands on deck. So I get out of my house, get in my land cruiser, and drive off in a bit of a rush. A few minutes pass and I’m about 3 miles away from work. I stop at a red light in this really busy intersection on the most busy fucking road in the entire country. There are car crashes here almost every other day onetime it happened twice in one day, so it is no surprise that I got into one at this intersection.  So the light turned green and I was in rush so I was well in front of the cars beside me. Then just as I’m about to clear the intersection a big red minivan t-bones me and we both go sliding in different directions (me not as much because my car is much heavier than hers). I almost passed out because of shock and looked out my window to see who dropped a missile strike to the right of my car. I get out of my car and it is in pretty bad shape. There is a huge dent right next to the passenger side door and the glass is broken on the mirror luckily nothing else that is visible. Enter EM AND PK EM: WHAT WERE YOU DOING, TRYING TO DRIVE AHEAD LIKE THAT ON RED LIGHT!!!!! YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME OR MY BABY IN THAT CRASH AND WE HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT BIRTHDAY TO GO TO!!!!!!!!!!! Me: I’m sorry but it was a green light for me not for you and I had the right of way. EM:(in a quiet accusatory tone) No you didn’t have the right of way WE had the right of way not you. Me: Explain to me how you had the right of way. EM: I don’t have to explain to you you drunk asshole! (Once again underage never drank in my life)Are you going to pay for my car or what! Her car (the red minivan) looks almost like the front of it was blown up then rammed by a hundred bulls and a couple wrecking balls. I am honestly surprised that she and her son survived because the drivers seat headrest was impaled by a piece of metal. Satan is most likely protecting his hell-spawn from any harm so she can be the biggest Karen this world has ever seen. Me: um no you are going to pay for it along with the damage you did to my car.(this was the wrong thing to say) EM: EXCUSE ME YOU DRUNK BASTARD YOU HONESTLY THINK I’M GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR SHITY ASS TRUCK THAT YOU AND YOUR DRINKING BUDDY PROBABLY PULLED OUT OF A TRASH PILE!!!! Me: yes bitch.(again also wrong thing to say) EM: HOW DARE YOU TREAT ME LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF MY KID YOU STUPID PIECE OF SHIT!!! MY DARLING SHOULD NEVER BE EXPOSED TO YOUR POTTY MOUTH!!! YOUR MOTHER PROBABLY LEFT YOU FOR DEAD BECAUSE YOU WERE THE MOST UGLY PIECE OF SHIT IN THE WHOLE FAMILY OF TWENTY KIDS AND THE ORPHANAGE THAT YOU CURRENTLY LIVE IN GOT TIRED OF YOUR BULLSHIT SO THEY GAVE YOU A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GOT BUY THIS PIECE OF SHIT LUMP OF METAL WITH WHEELS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Me:(Angry as hell) that is it I’m calling the cops if someone hasn’t already done so. PK: Mommy please stop harassing him he’s done nothing wrong. EM: HE’S DONE EVERYTHING WRONG!!!!!! About 10 minutes later of yelling three cop cars and an ambulance arrive PO: excuse me sir what happened here? Me: well I was go- EM: it was horrible officer this man was drunk driving (once again I was clearly underage)and ran a red light which was clearly visible and almost killed me and my baby. Me: that is not true officer this woman is clearly lying to you you can see that I am sober and there were a ton of witnesses to the accident(and what ensued) and they can tell you that she is in the wrong. PO: well I might as well check both of you and the security cameras. (There were security cameras in the intersection that recorded everything) EM: (clearly seeing that she was going to get caught) Oh there’s no need of doing that we will just exchange info an- PO: I’m sorry mam but it is required that I know what happened and which of you is in the wrong so we will be watching the cam footage together. The police officer found the accident and saw that EM was clearly running a red light and she was speeding by at least 20 miles over the limit. (The limit was 50)He then checks us both with a breathalyzer and I am completely sober, but she (sry couldn’t remember the exact number) was the equivalent of (quoting the police officer)“having both eyes closed and driving with your feet” drunk. They even found a bottle of Jack Daniels in the passenger side back seat half empty. However, the best part is still to come. Turns out she was never going to a birthday party, she was actually leaving the city. Oh why you ask because turns out she had three pouches of cocaine (worth mabey $2000)in her trunk. Does it end there no no no no. She was packing heat and quite a bit for my state. That’s right police found a loaded handgun and a 6 inch switch blade in the center console. Combine all of that and you get $5,600 in repairs to my car and a couple thousand more or reprimands, ten and a half years in prison, three years on probation, and plenty of parenting classes. Not to mention the several hundred dollar speeding ticket she received before they found the drugs and weapons. EK was sent to his blood father who actually divorced his mother because of the drugs and her alcoholism. Personally I wouldn’t even call that waste of human potential a mother. She brought her only son on a drug trafficking trip. Sorry that this story is a little long I wanted to list every detail possible. My car is now fully repaired and me and that PO are good friends now and talk about this incident often. Thank you for reading. Edit: alright just because I forgot to say this in original post. Thank god none of the expensive parts in my car were damaged, the engine was fine, the suspension was perfect, and the springs were intact. Another edit: also the reason the kid was with the mom even after the divorce is because she was illegally taking him with her. I don’t know what she got for that but I know it is bad. Also if you guys think this story is fake you’d be wrong. I experienced this firsthand and it is horrifying. The only reason you guys say it’s fake is because you don’t know how many things that seem fake actually happen. Everything happens eventually. I will post a picture as soon as I can.

2035160,EMs Kids playing on active skatepark and EM scorns us and tries to steal one of our scooters when they get hit.,"Just seen an entitled parents story regarding kids playing in an active skatepark and then getting scorned by an EM for hitting their kids when they fell off their skateboards and it reminded me of my own EK and EM story regarding an outdoor skatepark... Firstly I can't deny I'm guilty of playing in am active skatepark when I was a lot younger (aren't we all) but if I ever did want to do so my mom made sure we got there before all the skaters and then as soon as one turned up I went into the kids park about 2m away. The one time I did get hit though was my own fault and my mom didn't go full Karen and just said sorry to the kids and we left as a rational person would... Anyway. Onto the story. TL;DR at the end. This happened about 5-6 years ago when I use to do scootering at the local skatepark every weekend with my friends. It was sort of a beginner skatepark with a quaterpipe, box with a ramp either side, a grind rail or two and two weird triangle things in the corner. the bigger better one being about 2 miles away but only the big kids who were serious about skating and BMX'ing went there so we tended to stay in this little one. The important thing was though... It was all metal lined... This meant it was dangerously slippy from the second it rained and the smell of small child frying filled the air when you fell off on a hot day. It was one extreme or another then a tiny bit of middle ground where you could semi safely use the park. As mentioned about 2m away was a kids park which when I use to play in the skatepark was absolutely shite and rusted to all hell but when I was scootering it had, had a full refurb and had all sorts of fancy swings and an obstacle course. Basically there was no reason to play in the skatepark anymore but there was always one EM that insisted their kids play in the skatepark while it was active. Kinda feel like these are the parents who leave their kids to play on the edge of a busy road... Anyway we'd been there since around 10 and had gone away had lunch ventured to the big kids skatepark effectively got chased away and then went back to our little park. It was about 4:30 and everyone had gone home as that was sorta late to us then. Except EM and kids who were playing on the skatepark while EM had her face burried in her blackberry (yup, blackberry). Now we were there so late as it was mid summer and the sun was nowhere near setting so the park had been in direct sun all day long and the sun was heat was radiating off the metal ramps but being young and dumb we carried on scootering as the park was empty...bar kids. We started dropping in off the quarter pipe and doing crappy bunnyhops over the box as that's pretty much all you could do there and the kids at first watched in awe from the side as we were older. As we carried on they played either side of the box on the grind rails as they noticed we weren't using them which was fair. But then one of them had the idea to start running between us as we dropped in, in sequence. As a few may know the brakes on 'stunt scooters' are basically decorative and at the bottom of the drop in there's no way your gonna shed any speed using it unless you decide to bail. The kids eventually timed their runs wrong and as I dropped in one ran across and I impacted him with nearly all the force of the drop and sent us both into the boxes ramp face down. Of course EM hearing the thud and subsequent crying from her kid gave her enough reason to get off of BBM and come storming over.  Her kid probably fueled by adrenaline had jumped up crying grabbed the rail on the side of the box also realising that was hot and then fell on his arse continuing to cry. I meanwhile was laying there semi dazed from headbutting the box waiting to come round fully before I stood up. Although as I came round the heat of the box hit me and I peeled myself up and looked at a silohette of an EM bearing down on me. Then the shouting started... EM: YOU HIT MY BOY WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING... Me: Still dazed didn't respond and just shaded by eyes slightly and looked at her like 'what?' EM: WELL!!?? WHY DID YOU HIT HIM ? WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP? My mates little brother was a little gobby for his age and didn't really know when to shut up but for once this was useful. MLB for mates little bro from now on. MLB: Lady he ran Infront of him at the bottom of the ramp EM: WHY DIDN'T HE STOP THEN? MY BOY WAS JUST PLAYING YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE! WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS? MLB: Were aloud to be here on our own. EM: WHAT? WHY? NO YOUR NOT! YOUR TOO YOUNG. MLB,In a weird condescending tone that he does: WeRe aLoUd TO bE HerE. EM Gave up on him and came back to me. `SO WHY DID YOU HIT HIM YOU COULD'VE STOPPED I SAW YOU` She wasn't looking at the time of impact. Me: What? No I couldn't have I was going too fast. EM: YES YOU COULD HAVE, USE YOUR BRAKES. Me: Lady it doesn't work. EM: OF COURSE IT WORKS WHATS WRONG WITH IT? YOU SHOULD'VE USED THAT INSTEAD OF HITTING MY BOY. She grabbed by scooter and her boy and dragged them back over to her bench and finished her BBMing before trying to leave with it. We started shouting at her and she just ignored us. At this point LMB had the actually genius idea of riding at her and then jumping off of his scooter and launching it at her effectively knee capping her causing her to screech drop my scooter down hard and then notice his had shiny wheels on it and grab his instead. We followed up to the carpark where hers was the only car there so wasn't hard to find her car and closed the little metal gate and I used my mates other brothers scooter to wedge it shut with the bars before confronting her as she tried to load MLBs scooter into her tiny boot which she was failing to do with one hand while holding crying kid with the other. She ignored us and carried on and got it in and tried to close the boot but my mate stopped her from doing so while she shouted at him and me MLB and other brother started shouting for help. By pure coincidence was nearby a park attendant came over to investigate the shouting at which point EM started screeching `You, yOu, YoU iN tHe GrEEn` the park attendant came over `these brats are trying to steal my boys scooter` the park attendant simply responded with `what?` EM scolded him `ARE YOU STUPID THESE BOYS ATTACKED MY BOYS AND NOW ARE TRYING TO TAKE THEIR SCOOTER`. The park attendant looked at us all destraught and EM looking smug and stated `Ma'am I saw these boys scootering earlier today open your boot`. EM: `What? No! Why?` PA: `Ma'am just open your boot and show me your boys scooter` EM: `No, it doesn't matter anymore.

PA: `Ma'am I've seen these boys skating all day long and I've seen your boys playing without scooters so I know it's not yours` EM was silent... EM: `FINE!!!` EM flung open her boot grabbed the scooter and threw it across the carpark and nearly threw kid in the car too before slamming the door locking it and quickly reversing back and stopping at the gate before planting her hand on the horn.  The park attendant checked we were all okay checked our scooters then took his sweet time walking about 5 meters to the gate and ever so slowly going through his keys to remove the padlock while EM continued to honk. He also dropped them a few times while occasionally looking up and smiling at us. EM continued to honk and eventually the gate opened and she sped away. We said Thankyou to the park attendant. Gave him a bottle of cherry BAR soda we'd bought at lunch and went home. I didn't actually realise how long for that story was but I think it fits right in here. Hope you all enjoyed.

3872189,How do you deal with a hoarding SO?,"I cannot stand clutter, and clean my house often. While I can't stand to see junk laying around, and hold little sentimental value of objects, gifts or otherwise, my SO holds on to everything. We just got in an argument as I asked them to take a blender pitcher back to their house as it has been in my closet collecting dust for months now. The base of the blender is at their house. There is no reason the pitcher should be at my house. They honestly got upset at me for even asking. As I was throwing stuff away, I went through the part of my counter where I keep important things I need to deal with later. I was getting ready to throw out a small pile of papers as I don't need them anymore, and they said, `you are not going to throw away the blue envelope, are you?` This blue envelope has not been touched at all since August. I got tired of it being there, so I responded, `yes, I am throwing it away. If you want it, do something with it, other than keeping it on the counter.` They got mad and defensive at me.  They hold onto to everything, I hold on to nothing. They even keep the wrist bands for festivals they have attended. They don't see a difference between me having art on my walls and them keeping envelopes and wrist bands, stating that `words are art, too`. While I agree that words can be art, this envelope is not art. It is a blue envelope that hasn't been looked at in months. We are moving into their house in July. I fear that the house will be cluttered since they cannot throw anything away. I keep things tidy and minimal. How do you deal with this situation? I don't want to have arguments every time I get rid of something useless, like a blue envelope.",None,subs,minimalism

1924182,on Amount of workload varying too drastically between schools in same school district,"Agreed, but there’s a lot more that goes into it than just whose elements.  Finland has made a commitment to equality—in the US, we tend to focus on achievement. The best schools in the US are on par with anything in the world (if Massachusetts were a nation, its test scores would place it around number 4) while we also have some of the lowest performing schools.  In America, the quality of your school depends on your zip code. If your family has money, if your community has money, you’re gonna achieve and excel, and Americans tend to be okay with that. “Let ’em pull themselves up by their bootstraps*” and the attitude that, if you’re on top, you did something to deserve it.  In Finland (and many of the Scandinavian nations) there’s more commitment to equality. There’s a concerted effort that the poor are not going to be left to drown. I’ve taught in rural schools where water was in the halls and in places where the median house price was a million dollars—educational attainment had more to do with hungry kids sleeping in their cars versus kids who had private tutors to help.  You don’t see that kind of disparity in Finland. You see carefully crafted, well designed lessons by well paid teachers taught to students who have a social safety net and are ready to learn. In my opinion, that leads to more of Finland’s success than the lack of homework.  (And the Asian nations tend to do even better, and the model there is a degree of academic hard work American students would run screaming from... and, btw, I’m fine with not going that far. There is a need for fun and for play.) I’ve been at this for twenty years, in five states, in poor schools and in rich ones. None are perfect, but the kids who did best had homework that was tied to what they were learning. If you told me I couldn’t assign homework, I’d tell you that your decision was going to injure students and hinder their education.  Again, just my .02.

4344929,Current iostream status in C++?,"TL;DR: What is the status of the current iostreams in C++, in particular:  are they discouraged from being used? what are the alternatives? is there an ongoing work in the committee to replace them?  &#x200B; I have been actively working with standard stream just for a couple of days, so excuse me if I am missing something, but here is a list of questions I have got:  Where is fsync() in std::? Or, in a more general wording, what are the guarantees the standard provides that a file will actually write my data to disk? You do need to call this function if you want to write a file to disk (not just pretend). 23 combinations of various state flags (iostate) give rise to a whole host of checking functions: good(), eof(), fail(), bad(), operator!(), operator bool(). Is not it too much? Suppose your are using a stream, would you know without documentation which one and when to use? Why are the names of methods so cryptic: btowc, sbumpc, xalloc, showmanyc, epptr, sungetc? Are they ZeroCopy streams?  Why stringstream::str() cannot return (or set) an underlying string by rvalue? It requires copying. Imagine a have a stream (let's consider two cases: based on a file or on a string) and I want to write a function that calculates md5 sum. How can I write it in such a way that it do not require any copying in case the stream is based on a string (that is a legitimate requirement, since C++ has always had this tenet: `What you don’t use, you don’t pay for [BS94]. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better`)? As far as I understand, any stream implementation has an internal continuous buffer. In the case of string, this buffer could be the string itself, in case of file it could be either chunk of the file, or even entire mmap()'ed file. How do I get access directly to the buffer in the current C++ streams?  All operations by one? The closest I managed to get to the buffer is streambuf, but the problem is that all its public functions work only with one(!) character at a time: `reads one character from the input...` and so on...  Just in case you want to know how it can be implemented otherwise, have a look at Google's ZeroCopyInputStream. Finally, my question: Can please anyone rebut what I have pointed out above, or tell the status of the current iostreams:  are they discouraged from being used? what are the alternatives? is there an ongoing work in the committee?  &#x200B; P.S.

3296677,What do directors REALLY do?,"For most of my life I thought a director basically took what the writers wrote, and directed the actors to perform it in the way that the writers intended. But lately I'm seeing people more or less seem to think that a director MAKES the movie. Example of a quote I've seen in the press: `Quentin Tarantino's Star Trek project is sweary and R-rated` Now correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't the actual writers of the movie include the dialog to make it have curse words and ultimately make it R-rated? Or maybe that's just what directors 'used' to do, and now directors are hired to not only direct, but to also help write the movie also? I guess I just see a lot where someone says something like `That's a JJ Abrams Star Wars movie` meaning something like it's either good, or not good, because of HIM, not because of the script that was given to him to actually just direct.

1541706,"How does an author like Thomas Harris write something like ""Cari Mora""?","Thomas Harris, celebrated author of Silence of the Lambs and creator of Dr. Hannibal Lector, came out with Cari Mora, his first release is 13 years. I read it without knowing anything about it and was quite shocked at how skin deep it was. Navigating to goodreads.com, it seems like other disliked it more than I did. The surprising thing is, Harris is a perfectionist about his work, so it caught me off-guard at how sloppy and rushed this book felt. I don't know if I'm overthinking it, but I'm wondering if the agent thought his original manuscript was too complex, and just simplified it in hopes of getting more readers. Like, maybe someone was thinking that a writer like Harris can't be successful in the Digital Age, so the agent went in and tweaked the life out of a story they were concerned was too complicated could make this on-demand era to maintain focus. Is that a possible explanation for Cari Mora's quality? I don't want to bash Harris because he has an amazing career. As an author myself, I know how it feels to get a bad review, especially one that offers nothing constructive to the criticism.

29336,on 7-Zip exposes a bug in Windows's large memory pages. Causes data corruption and crashes in Windows and other programs.,"Surely communication is not your main problem if your company lacks resources but if you ever get frustrated because $MORON won't do $RIGHT_THING (because he's lacking resources, too), you might need that `paper trail of blame` that the LKML is for Linux. I'd strongly discourage verbal insults or yelling since it naturally gets emotional quickly and leads nowhere. If written and publicly archived it's more likely that you lean back, analyse accusations and rethink your point. It saves a lot of time since people tend to defend themselves when being yelled at (or insulted) and you quickly get to the point when it's obvious if your defense is valid or if you're wrong. (I think there are cases where Linus changed his mind in a hot argument). Also, it's not the case that the LKML would be a place of swearing and yelling. That'd be awful but luckily those kind of hot-topics are rare in mature software development.  The delay between bugfixes has nothing to do with communication.  No. But the introduction of new bugs has a lot to do with it.  It has to do with resources.  A major portion of the Linux kernel was done in free time by volunteers. You always lack resources with volunteers. As with corporate policy, I'd solely blame the bosses for this. (btw. I also understand, that bosses like to avoid lawsuits - insults, harsh work environment,... Of course they prefer to setup a ruleset for communication. That's a problem that Linus doesn't have as `boss`.)  Once I check it in, depending on whether it's client side or server side it can take between 3 months up to (forever) for that fix to make it out to a customer. Server side has at least 3 environments to make it through before it hits production  I doubt that a critical fix would take that long, even at your company. Linux also takes months for non-critical stuff but OPs bug is severe. Also remember that the linux kernel runs on hundreds of platforms in a gazillion configurations. Android, Routers, Supercomputers. All from the same codebase.  We really don't like bugs to reach the public, as these are the most expensive.   Can't be too expensive if your boss risks them instead of paying more paychecks. Resources are always planned tightly or they'd be `wasted` in terms of business rules.  The release cycle is far longer than the dev time to fix a bug, everywhere I've ever worked.  Yet, linux (gnu manages to push fixes in hours with little to no impact (of the fix, not the bug itself). I'm thinking of shellshock, heartbleed etc.  a) that's almost never the actual case, the code is far more complex  if the code is complex, it is bad and needs refactoring. Complexity means bugs and is the enemy. Surely it's not completly avoidable in production but only a small portion of companies spend resources on removing complexity. Mainly it's adding features and not touching old code until it's absolutely necessary. So $MORON never has to fix $BAD_THING he produced years ago. Finding and fixing old bugs doesn't earn money, new features do. That's how your boss thinks .  b) even if it is the case and I can fix it in two lines, you still have the entire release cycle before you'll see it.  Testing is a b*tch but unit and integration testing should cover the bigger part of your codepath. Quick release cycles and automated testing is probably the most important thing in software dev. (Regulating language or complaining about tone is not)  Think about getting a kernel fix into that and how long it takes from commit to it being downloaded to the average users machine and installed.  I don't use Ubuntu but I'm sure it receives security fixes within hours like any other major distro.  Yes, you can just download Linus's tree and build it yourself, but (almost) nobody does that.  Sure, upstream maintainers do that. It's one layer of QE before stuff gets merged into distros.  For the vast majority of the folks who use Linux, they're getting it in a distribution on a release cycle. Just like every other software product.  Sure, and for non-critical stuff it often takes years for mainline support. The opensource community also lacks resources and often goes the hard way (like reverse engineering). It wouldn't achieve anything without a passionate, objective &amp; honest discourse. I'm aware that there are tons of communities with varying policies but I always liked the linux-kernel culture to seek consent. I'm also troubled by the fact that this kind of oligarchic-dictatorship-software-development seems to work so good ;) TL;DR: commercial software development is FUBAR - Harsh public shaming, like Linus does, won't solve that but it can save precious time in some cases. ;)",None,comments,programming

4129028,I'm extremely impressed with what I wrote — a rare occurance.,"Over the past week, thanks to a situation I presume you're all familiar with, I've been doing some work on my novel. I have never particularly suffered from Writer's Block, so most of my practice came from the fact that every so often I began a chapter: sometimes it was criminals sneaking through a forest in Belarus, another time a girl who ran away from her home in Idaho, another where the dictator of the world forgot how to speak, each an equally interesting prompt that could have been a beginning to a magnificent story. My aim was always to do a 90K by reaching ninety-thousand words, at which point I would consider myself successful, but I never truly found the time. I would write somewhere between five thousand and six thousand words on that inspiring day, and then find myself distracted, not wanting to come back to the same universe again for at least a few weeks, by which point a brand new idea would hit me. That's how I spent the last five years. I've reached a 7K last night, which is only about thirteen percent there, and I can read through the whole thing in less than fifteen minutes, but each word I read is something new. I come across brilliant interpretations of human emotion and the natural world, amazing figurative word choice, splendid introductions of characters. I always considered myself to be a somewhat below average writer, and yet, I could see most of this in an actual printed work to be copied and sold.

I think I got the intended experience in that I was rather confused on things until I watched some external material that laid everything out in front of me and gave it all more thought, and I don't think that was bad. I enjoyed the experience, I've never seen anything like that and I really felt captivated by going into what felt like unknown and impossible science; it felt like going into very dangerous waters just for curiosity sake and I love that.",/u/Daijoubu_Ka,summary,movies
