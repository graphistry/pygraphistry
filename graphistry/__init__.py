    Create a graph out of the dataframe, and return the graph components as dataframes,
    and the renderable result Plotter. It reveals relationships between the rows and between column values.
    This transform is useful for lists of events, samples, relationships, and other structured high-dimensional data.
    The transform creates a node for every row, and turns a row's column entries into node attributes.
    If direct=False (default), every unique value within a column is also turned into a node.
    Edges are added to connect a row's nodes to each of its column nodes, or if direct=True, to one another.
    Nodes are given the attribute 'type' corresponding to the originating column name, or in the case of a row, 'EventID'.
    Consider a list of events. Each row represents a distinct event, and each column some metadata about an event.
    If multiple events have common metadata, they will be transitively connected through those metadata values.
    The layout algorithm will try to cluster the events together.
    Conversely, if an event has unique metadata, the unique metadata will turn into nodes that only have connections to the event node, and the clustering algorithm will cause them to form a ring around the event node.
    Best practice is to set EVENTID to a row's unique ID,
    SKIP to all non-categorical columns (or entity_types to all categorical columns),
    and CATEGORY to group columns with the same kinds of values.
    The optional ``opts={...}`` configuration options are:
    * 'EVENTID': Column name to inspect for a row ID. By default, uses the row index.
    * 'CATEGORIES': Dictionary mapping a category name to inhabiting columns. E.g., {'IP': ['srcAddress', 'dstAddress']}.  If the same IP appears in both columns, this makes the transform generate one node for it, instead of one for each column.
    * 'DELIM': When creating node IDs, defines the separator used between the column name and node value
    * 'SKIP': List of column names to not turn into nodes. For example, dates and numbers are often skipped.
    * 'EDGES': For direct=True, instead of making all edges, pick column pairs. E.g., {'a': ['b', 'd'], 'd': ['d']} creates edges between columns a->b and a->d, and self-edges d->d.
