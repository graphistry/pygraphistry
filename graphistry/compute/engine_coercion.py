def ensure_engine_match(g: Plottable, requested_engine: Engine) -> Plottable:
    """Ensure Plottable's DataFrames match the requested engine.

    If there's a mismatch between the actual DataFrame type and the
    requested engine, converts DataFrames to match the user's request.
    This is a defensive pattern for handling schema-changing operations
    (UMAP, hypergraph) that may alter DataFrame types mid-execution.

    The conversion is a no-op when types already match, making it safe
    to call at multiple layers (chain, let, call) without performance penalty.

    :param g: Plottable to check and potentially convert
    :type g: Plottable
    :param requested_engine: Engine type requested by user (pandas/cudf)
    :type requested_engine: Engine
    :returns: Plottable with DataFrames matching requested engine
    :rtype: Plottable
    :raises: Never raises - returns original graph on error (graceful degradation)

    **Example::**

        # After a schema-changing operation that might have changed types
        result = execute_umap(g)  # May return cuDF even if g was pandas
        result = ensure_engine_match(result, Engine.PANDAS)  # Converts back

    **Performance::**

        - No-op path (types match): ~1 microsecond
        - Conversion path (types differ): ~10-100ms depending on data size
