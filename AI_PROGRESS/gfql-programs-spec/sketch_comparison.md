## Conclusion

The evolution from sketch.md to sketch1X.md represents a successful transformation from an initial RFC to a production-ready specification. Every original concept has been preserved and enhanced with the additional context needed for real-world implementation. The document now serves as both a feature specification and an implementation guide, ready for development teams to execute against.

The phased implementation approach ensures that core functionality can be delivered quickly while building toward the complete vision over a 6-month timeline. With comprehensive security, performance, and operational considerations, sketch1X.md provides a solid foundation for GFQL Programs to become a cornerstone feature of PyGraphistry.
