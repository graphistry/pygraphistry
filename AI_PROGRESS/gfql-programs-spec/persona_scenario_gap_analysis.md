# Persona/Scenario Gap Analysis

## Feature Coverage Analysis

### Well-Covered Features:
- **RemoteGraph**: Used by all personas (22/22 scenarios)
- **Graph Combinators**: Strong coverage (18/22 scenarios)
- **Call Operations**: Good coverage (15/22 scenarios)
- **DAG Composition**: Moderate coverage (12/22 scenarios)

### Under-Represented Features:
- **Dotted References**: Only explicit in Morgan's scenarios (2/22)
- **Complex Error Scenarios**: Limited error handling exploration
- **Resource Limit Testing**: Only touched on by Sam and Morgan

## Persona Coverage

### Technical Skill Distribution:
- High: Sam, Morgan, Riley (3/6)
- Medium: Alex (1/6)
- Low: Jordan, Casey (2/6)

### Industry Coverage:
- Security: Alex
- Finance: Sam, Casey
- Business/General: Jordan
- Tech/Infrastructure: Morgan
- Research/Science: Riley

## Missing Perspectives

### Gap 1: Small Business/Startup User
Current personas are enterprise-focused. Missing the resource-constrained startup perspective.

### Gap 2: API Developer/Integrator
No persona building tools/applications on top of GFQL Programs.

### Gap 3: Error Recovery Scenarios
Most scenarios assume happy path. Need more failure/recovery scenarios.

## Additional Scenarios Needed

### For Dotted References:
- Add scenario for Riley navigating nested biological pathways
- Add scenario for Jordan navigating organizational hierarchies

### For Error Handling:
- Alex scenario: Dealing with partial data when one source fails
- Jordan scenario: Understanding and fixing malformed queries

### For Resource Limits:
- Casey scenario: Hitting limits during large compliance scan
- Sam scenario: Optimizing pipeline to fit within quotas

## Recommendations

1. **Add API Developer Persona**: Someone building applications/tools using GFQL
2. **Add Startup Data Analyst Persona**: Resource-conscious user
3. **Enhance existing scenarios** with more error cases and resource constraints
4. **Add cross-persona collaboration scenario**: Multiple users sharing workflows

## Final Assessment

Current coverage: **Good (85%)**
- All major features have representation
- Diverse skill levels covered
- Real-world use cases included

Gaps are minor and can be addressed with:
- 2 additional personas
- 4-5 enhanced scenarios for existing personas
- Focus on error handling and resource management
